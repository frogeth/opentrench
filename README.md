# trenchfeed

One live feed for your Discord channels and Telegram chats, with contract
addresses highlighted and copyable. Runs entirely on your machine.

> **Warning.** The Discord side uses your **own account token** (a self-bot).
> That is against Discord's Terms of Service and can get the account banned.
> Use at your own risk. The Telegram side uses your own account via the
> official MTProto API, which Telegram permits.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start          # http://127.0.0.1:3210
```

Dev mode with hot reload (`http://localhost:5173`):

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Setup (in the browser, ⚙ top right)

1. **Discord** — paste your user token, save. Then tick the channels to watch.
2. **Telegram** — enter API ID + hash from https://my.telegram.org, save.
   Enter phone → code → 2FA password if prompted. Then tick chats to watch.

Everything is stored in `backend/config.json` (git-ignored, mode 600).
Nothing is sent anywhere except to Discord and Telegram.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```
